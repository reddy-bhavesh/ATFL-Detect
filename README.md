# ATFL-Detect
In this project, we aim to enhance the performance of a VGG-16 convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the classification of normal and abnormal anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) conditions from MRI images. The VGG-16 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, serves as the base model, which is fine-tuned by unfreezing the top layers to allow for additional training. We employ various optimization techniques, including experimenting with different optimizers (Adam, RMSprop, SGD with momentum) and learning rates, to identify the most effective training parameters. Data augmentation strategies are applied to increase the robustness of the model by artificially expanding the training dataset through random transformations. Additional dense layers and dropout layers are incorporated into the model architecture to improve its generalization capabilities. To further optimize the model, we utilize Keras Tuner for automated hyperparameter tuning, systematically searching for the best combination of hyperparameters. The training process is enhanced with the use of callbacks such as EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, and ReduceLROnPlateau to prevent overfitting and dynamically adjust the learning rate. The final model is evaluated on a validation set, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and robustness. This comprehensive approach to fine-tuning and hyperparameter optimization provides a robust framework for the automated detection of ATFL abnormalities in MRI images, potentially aiding in more accurate and efficient clinical diagnoses.
